# This is the input for scripts/generate_road_colours.py

# All road classes colours will be generated for, in order of importance
# (biggest first).
roads:
  - motorway
  - trunk
  - primary
  - secondary

# The starting and ending hue. The range goes from 0 to 360, with 0 and 360
# representing red.
hue: [0, 0]  # Set hue to 0 for grayscale

# The lightness and chroma (also known as saturation) for each type of colour.
# Lightness ranges from 0 to 100; dark to bright.
# Chroma ranges from 0 to 100 too; unsaturated to fully saturated.
